# Number Guessing Game

This Python script powers a simple number guessing game. The game challenges the player to think of a number between 0 and 1000, and the script attempts to guess it within 10 tries. Players provide feedback on each guess, indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower, leading to a game of numerical hide-and-seek.

## Features

- Clear and concise rules explanation.
- Interactive guessing with user feedback to guide the game.
- Utilizes an efficient algorithm to guess the number within 10 attempts.
- Automatic reset if an incorrect input is detected.

```

## How to Play

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your Python environment.
2. **Think of a Number**: Choose a number between 0 and 1000.
3. **Provide Feedback**: After each guess, use the following inputs to guide the computer:
   - `y` if the guess is correct.
   - `l` if your number is lower than the guess.
   - `h` if your number is higher than the guess.
4. **Winning the Game**: The game continues until the computer guesses your number correctly, which it will always do within 10 attempts.
